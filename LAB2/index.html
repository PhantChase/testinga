    <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, 
    and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a
    nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
    <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We 
    also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
    into their natural environment.</p>
    <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care 
    for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a 
    sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
